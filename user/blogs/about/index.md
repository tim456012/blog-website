An idiot who love video games, obsessed with making them. Always a neophyte on creativity; it's hard, it's elusive, it's pellucid, but there's elegance in the emergence. And I love every bit of it.

It's beautiful to make something breathtaking through programming. Never stop creating, failing, and learning.

## Intro

No matter how you found this website or are even interested in reading this article. Welcome here! My name's Danny and nice to meet you all. I'm a newbie game developer who just moving to Toronto from Hong Kong around two months ago at the time I'm writing this post. Since this is my first blog post, ~(And I actually don't know where to start lol)~ I should share what will you find in this blog and my story first.

## About the blog

Most of the posts will focus on game development topics, such as dev logs or study progress (computer graphics or software engineering). Sometime there may be book reviews or other things I'd like to share. Ultimately, I hope this blog is not just a place to store my cheat sheets but also something that can help others who are also creating video games.

## About me

I was born in Hong Kong and I am 23 years old now. My life has been closely tied to video game when I was little. I've played various video games on Nintendo Game Boy Pocket, DVDs, Flash Player, and Nintendo DS. Many great games have given me unforgettable memories, which guided me to become a game developer today. After graduating from high school, I took a diploma and degree program in game software development, building my fundamental skills over four years. Not long ago, I quit my job where I had worked for a year after graduating from college, and moved to Canada to start a new journey.

### Hobbies

#### Playing video game

Well, I've played different genres except for horror theme or games have similar vibe. Here is the games which inspired me so much back to the day I played:
- Croket! Great Jikuu no Boukensha
- Jet Impulse
- Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar
- Keroro RPG: Kishi to Musha to Densetsu no Kaizoku
- Suikoden Tierkreis
- Grand Theft Auto IV

Here is the games I recently playing:
- Arknights
- Final Fantasy XIV
- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Xenoblade Chronicles DE

#### Listening music
Music is my spiritual source, helping me get through the hardship of everyday life. I mostly listen the original soundtracks or pop music created by Japanese artists, as ACG culture had a huge impact on me while growing up. One of my favorite artist is the composer [Hiroyuki Sawano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Sawano), a legendary composer whose work I feel fortunate to have encountered in my life. 

As you may have noticed from the preamble, I quoted a refrain from one of his vocal work, [ViEW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAp0oGjxaM), from his vocal project's second album, [2V-ALK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2V-ALK) (It's a great album by the way). The lyrics inspire me to hold on to my initial movitation in my heart while pursuing my goals, which prefectly aligns with my current situation.

## Special thanks

I want to express my gratitude and give credit to the creator of this blog, [kwchang0831](https://github.com/kwchang0831). He developed this awesome blog generator, **QWER**, built with SvelteKit. Thanks to its lightweight design and simplicity, I can easy focus on writing blog post instead of create and maintain the entire web project by myself. If you are also interested in starting your own blog, you can checkout the [project's repo](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER).
